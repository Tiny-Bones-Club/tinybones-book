# Community Update #2

Dear broners, the whole Tiny Bones team wishes you a happy and bullish new year 2022! 

We hope that this year will rhyme with prosperity and health for all of you. On our side, 2022 is going to be a crucial year for the project: as you know, we are working to bring you a playable Gravetown demo by the first quarter of the year.

To reach our goal, we have been joined by two new members. Bringing expertise to development and assets creation: Yza & Adpaar.

            Yza            |          Adpaar

Yza is a graphic and web designer who likes to test new mediums every day. She wasn’t much aware of the blockchain before, but fell in love with the project and the opportunity to get her hands on a new topic!  

Adpaar is a junior front end developer. He used to be a marketing guy and switched one year ago into coding. As a developer he has been involved in a few blockchain and NFT products in Spain before joining us. He spends most of his time learning and creating. Generative art and web3 are his new hobbies.
  
As usual, we are counting on the community to welcome them warmly!

## State of development

To quickly resume, last weeks have been about the creation of the core engine.  
There was a lot of work to do in order to build good foundations. This is a crucial element in the creation of our metaverse. Our work focused on movement mechanics, physics, camera rendering, collisions, performances, tests…  
All built with Javascript, ThreeJS and melting brains!  

As Yza joined recently, we are building new assets and defining a design process and an artistic direction. We will introduce in the next update more visuals of Gravetown!  
The real challenge for now resides in defining the whole multiplayer mechanics, testing them, having some feedback from you, and making it the way players want it.  
This process introduces a lot of new variables to deal with.  
But as always, nothing is impossible, and long story short, we’ve already started!

## Avalanche Summit
Like some of you, we’ll be in the alleys of Avalanche Summit, taking place in Barcelona from 22 to 27 March. We hope to meet our faithful broners to discuss Gravetown’s future together (along with drinking Sangria of course).

Stay tuned for more and more bullish news in the next weeks !  
  

We are builders, we are building it.
